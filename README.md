# My Online Resume
This is my online resume site build with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Toha](https://github.com/hugo-toha/toha/) theme.
<br>
<br>
The source files reside in **main** branch and, via GitHub actions, after every push the site is rendered in the **gh-pages** branch from where it is served through [github-pages](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/).
